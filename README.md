## Understanding Heart Failures and Mitigating Risks
### Introduction
Heart failure remains a significant concern globally, with cardiovascular diseases claiming a rising number of lives each year. Collaborating with the Heart Failure Society of America ('HFSA'), iHeart LLC embarked on a research endeavor to delve into the intricate relationship between key risk factors and heart failures. Through advanced data analysis techniques, our mission is to enhance awareness, education, and prevention strategies to combat the impact of heart failures on communities.

### Key Items
* Dataset: Explored a comprehensive dataset containing information on 299 heart failure cases.
* Objective: Investigated the correlation between various risk factors and heart failures.
* Data Exploration: Conducted thorough data exploration and preprocessing, including encoding categorical features and creating new data columns.
* Visualization: Employed Python-based visualization techniques to uncover insights into age-related mortality, gender distribution of heart failures, and other critical relationships.
* Cluster Analysis: Utilized hierarchical clustering and K-means clustering to identify distinct patient clusters based on attributes such as ejection fraction, serum creatinine, and follow-up period.
* Supervised Clustering: Developed a K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model to predict heart failure events with a 68% accuracy rate, highlighting the effectiveness of utilizing patient attributes for predictive analysis.
### Recommendations
* Public Awareness: Emphasize the significance of key risk factors such as high blood pressure and diabetes in contributing to heart failures.
* Symptom Awareness: Educate the general public about the symptoms of heart diseases to facilitate early detection and maximize survival rates.
* Preventive Measures: Advocate for preventive measures and regular screenings to mitigate the impact of heart failures on individuals and communities.
Through our collaborative efforts with HFSA, we aim to drive impactful change in the field of cardiovascular health, ultimately improving outcomes for patients and promoting heart wellness worldwide. ‚ù§Ô∏è
